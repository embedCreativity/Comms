# Comms
Simple Encrypted Socket Communication

This project ties together the Crypto and Socket projects that are also hosted on Embed Creativity's GitHub to form a 'Communication' library.

This Comm library supports both encrypted and non-encrypted communication with a very simple interface. Since I'm really lazy when it comes to documentation, please refer to the test server and test client source files to get an idea of how to use the interface. It's simple, I promise.
